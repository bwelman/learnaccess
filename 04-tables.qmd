## About tables {#sec-tables-about}

In a database, data is stored in tables. The tables themselves consists of fields for different kind of data. So there could be a field for the last name of a person and another field for the first name. Data can be displayed in different ways but is always stored in tables. In practice, you start with making an information analysis to determine which tables and fields you need. For larger databases, this is done through a process called normalizing. Mostly you also need to establish relationships between the tables, so data from one table can be linked to data in another table.

With empty tables, you can't do anything. So data has to be entered in tables. When these data are already available in other files, such as an Excel worksheet, then import from Excel is also an option.

## Fields in tables {#sec-tables-fields}

Fields are the design elements of a table. Data is stored in fields. The properties of a field define the characteristics and behavior of the data that is stored in the field. To create a field you need:

-   Field name (required)
-   Data type (required
-   Description (optional)

### Field names {#sec-tables-fields-names}

The design of the database determines what kind of data has to be stored in the field. Usually, the fields in the design have already been given a name and you are using that name. Always use meaningful names. Of course, you can give the field a description, but a clear name still works best.

Field names must meet the following requirements:

-   The name must be unique within the table.
-   The name may not start with a space.
-   The name may not contain the following characters: point, exclamation mark, and brackets \[ and \].

### Data types {#sec-tables-fields-datatypes}

The different data types, their possible values, and use.

The main characteristic of a field is the data type because it determines what type of data can be in the field. Data types can sometimes be confusing. For example, a field 's data type Text can contain both text and numbers (numeric data ), but a field of data type Number can contain only numeric data. If you don't know which of these two data types to use, think of the following rule of thumb.

When you have to make calculations with the content of the field, then use data type Number. Thus, the field for the price of an article is a numeric field and the field for an article number is a text field.

The data types in Access are:

: Data types in Access {#tbl-datatypes}

::: callout-note
In Access, you can set a field's data type to [Lookup Wizard]{.uicontrol}. Doing this starts the Lookup Wizard, which helps you create a Lookup field. A Lookup field displays either a list of values that is retrieved from a table or query, or it displays a static set of values that you specified when you created the field.
:::

### Field Properties {#sec-tables-fields-properties}

You can set additional field properties at a data type. The data type of the field determines which properties can be set. The most important and most frequently used properties are:

Field Size

:   Important at Text, Number, and sometimes AutoNumber. For a text field, you can specify the maximum length of the text. For a number field, you can specify what kind of numbers can be entered, like `Byte`, `Integer`, `Long Integer`, `Decimal`, `Single`, and `Double`.

Format

:   It can be used with most of the data types. It allows you to control how the content of the field will look when it is displayed in tables, queries, forms, and reports. You can use all valid number formats, and often there is also a list of predefined formats available.

Decimal Places

:   Important at `Number` en `Currency`. To specify the number of decimal places for displaying the numbers.

Default Value

:   It can be used with most of the data types. Automatically enters a value for the field when a new record is created. Very useful when the value is often the same. The value can be changed afterward.

Required

:   It can be used with most of the data types. The possible values are `No` (default) and `Yes`.

::: callout-note
A special role is there for the properties `Input mask`, `Validation Rule`, and `Validation Text`. These can be used in the validation of data, that let you control the conditions for the entered data.
:::

### Number field size property {#sec-tables-fields-size}

Possible values for data type number.

-   `Byte`: For integers that range from 0 to 255.
-   `Integer`: For integers that range from -32,768 to +32,767.
-   `Long Integer`: For integers that range from -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.
-   `Single`: For numeric floating-point values that range from -3.4 x 1038 to +3.4 x 1038 and up to seven significant digits.
-   `Double`: For numeric floating-point values that range from -1.797 x 10308 to +1.797 x 10308 and up to 15 significant digits.
-   `Decimal`: For numeric values that range from -9,999... x 1027 to 9,999... x 1027.

## Validation {#sec-tables-validation}

To ensure that a user enters data in a particular way, you can make use of an input mask. Additionally, you can also use a validation rule to control if the value entered meets certain requirements and if not indicating the user on it through a validation text.

### Input masks {#sec-tables-fields-inputmasks}

An input mask ensures a solid, mandatory format for data entry in a field. An input mask consists of a series of characters and symbols. The data entered must conform to the pattern of the mask. For example, with an input mask, you can ensure that a telephone number consists of exactly 10 digits. Input masks are possible for the data type `Text`, `Numeric`, `Currency`, and `Date/Time`.

The input mask also determines the number of characters that can be entered. Input masks are made up of one mandatory part and two optional parts, and each part is separated by a semicolon. The purpose of each part is as follows:

-   The first part is mandatory. It includes the mask characters along with placeholders and literal data such as parentheses, periods, and hyphens.

-   The second part is optional and refers to the embedded mask characters and how they are stored within the field. If the second part is set to 0, the characters are stored with the data, and if it is set to 1, the characters are only displayed and not stored.

-   The third part of the input mask is also optional and indicates a single character or space that is used as a placeholder. By default, Access uses the underscore (\_). If you want to use another character, enter it in the third part of your mask.

::: callout-note
Setting the second part to 1 can save database storage space.

:  Placeholder and literal characters for an input mask {#tbl-inputmask-symbols}

You can either quickly add input masks by using the [Input Mask Wizard]{.uicontrol} or specify masks manually by typing custom masks to the Input Mask field property setting.

::: {#exm-tables-ustelephonenr}
**US telephone number**

Input mask: `(999) 000-000;0;-`

Explanation:

-   `(999)` user can enter three digits as area code
-   `000-000` user must enter six digits
-   `;0` specifies that the mask characters will be stored along with the data.
-   `;-` specifies that a hyphen (-) instead of the underscore (_) is to be used as the placeholder character.

:::

::: {#exm-tables-zipcode}
**ZipCode**

Input mask: `0000\ >LL`

Explanation:

-   `0000` user must enter four required digits (0 t / m 9).
-   `\` indicates that a blank space is displayed. You don't need to enter this space.
-   `>LL` user must enter two required letters that will be converted to uppercase.
:::

### Validation rule and text {#sec-tables-fields-validationrules}

Validation rules can restrict what a user can enter in a particular field. This way you can ensure that only values ​​can be entered that meet certain conditions. Does the input not meet the conditions then a message appears on the screen.

Validation rule

:   An expression that needs to be true for the entered data in the field. When you enter or change data in a field, Access checks if the expression is true. If not, a warning message with the value of the validation text is displayed. You then need to change the value until the validation rule is true.

Validation text

:   The text that will be displayed when a value is entered which does not satisfy the expression in the validation rule.

When creating expressions you should consider the following:

-   Field names must be enclosed in square brackets, like `[OrderDate]`.
-   Dates must be surrounded by #, like `#12-31-2010#`.
-   Text must be surrounded by double quotes, like "Amsterdam".
-   Wild cards are permitted. Most known are
    -   `?`: one character
    -   `*`: multiple characters
    -   `#`: one digit

@tbl-operators lists the most used operators.

## Creating a List Box {#sec-tables-listbox}

Purpose: Create a list box in a field so that the values can be selected from a list.

When only a limited number of pre-defined values should be entered in a field, then the use of a list box can be very useful. For example, the [Customers]{.varname} table has a field [Region]{.varname} in which only the values `North` and `South` are allowed. In the following steps, the data type for this field will be changed in a list box.

::: callout-warning
Unfortunately, the list box does not automatically update the forms that are based on this table as the form Registration. To make the list box work in the form Registration, you must in design view first remove the field Region and then added again. That's not part of this task.

## Relations between tables {#sec-tables-relations}

Between two tables exists a relation when a key field from one table is linked to a key field in the other table. The linked fields in both tables have mostly the same name and the same data type. What relations should be established is the result of the normalization process which removes the redundant information and puts this in multiple tables.

When tables are related, you can create queries, forms, and reports where the information can be combined from multiple tables and is displayed as an entity.

### One-to-many relationship {#sec-tables-relationtype-one2many}

A one-to-many relationship is the most common kind of relationship. In this kind of relationship, a row in table A can have many matching rows in table B. But a row in table B can have only one matching row in table A. This is sometimes called a parent-child relation.

An example is the relation between the tables [Customers]{.varname} and [Orders]{.varname}. Between these two tables is a link on the basis of the field [CustomerCode]{.varname}. A customer from the [Customers]{.varname} table can have several orders in the [Orders]{.varname} table. But every order belongs to only one customer. The table [Customers]{.varname} is on the one-side of the relation and the table [Orders]{.varname} on the many-side. The table [Customers]{.varname} is the primary table in the relation and the table [Orders]{.varname} is the related table. Through this link, all orders can be collected for a customer.

![One-to-many relation between the tables customers and orders.](images/tables/relationship-customers-orders.png){#fig-relationship-customers-orders}

For this type of relationship the field with which the link is realized at one side of the relationship should be unique. In almost all cases the **primary key** of the table is used. The field at the many-side of the relation is called the **foreign key**.

![Example of a one-to-many relationship.](images/tables/relationship-one2many.png){#fig-relationship-one2many}

In Access, a one-to-many relationship is displayed by a line between the primary key and foreign key, with the number 1 at the one-side and the infinity symbol ∞ at the may-side.

### One-to-one relationship {#sec-tables-relationtype-one2one}

In a one-to-one relationship, a row in table A can have no more than one matching row in table B, and vice versa. This kind of relationship is not common, because most information that is related in this manner would be in one table. This will sometimes be done to divide a table with many fields in two tables, each with fewer fields. In general, one should try to avoid this situation.

### Many-to-many relationship {#sec-tables-relationtype-many2many}

In a many-to-many relationship, a row in table A can have many matching rows in table B, and vice versa. A many-to-many relationship can not be defined directly in Access. You create such a relationship by defining a third table that is called a **junction table**. This junction table is related to each of both tables through a one-to-many relationship.

An example is the table [Orders]{.varname} and the table [Boxes]{.varname}. Each order is likely to contain several boxes and each box is probably on multiple orders. The table [OrderDetails]{.varname} can act as the junction table. The table [OrderDetails]{.varname} is related to the table [Orders]{.varname} in a one-to-many relationship via the field [OrderCode]{.varname}. And the table [OrderDetails]{.varname} is also related to the table [Boxes]{.varname} in a one-to-many relationship via the field [BoxCode]{.varname}.

![Example many-to-many relationship.](images/tables/relationship-many2many.png){#fig-relationship-many2many}

### Relationships: creating, modifying and deleting {#sec-tables-relationships-edit}

Relations between tables can be created in the window ***Relationships***. In this window, you can also modify or delete a relation. The window can be made visible by clicking on [tab Database Tools \> Relationships (group Relationships)]{.uicontrol}.

![Window Relationships.](images/tables/relationships-window.png){#fig-relationships-window}

The ribbon contains commands for editing the relationships.

![Ribbon Design relationships.](images/tables/relationships-ribbon-design.png){#fig-relationships-ribbon-design}

If there are no relations made earlier then the window Relationships is empty. Through the button [Show Table]{.uicontrol}, a window with tables (and queries) is displayed with which you can add tables.

A relation between two tables can be created by dragging the primary key from one table to the foreign key in another table. Then the dialog box ***Edit Relationships*** is displayed.

\[Dialog box Edit Relationships.\]images/tables/relationship-edit-boxes-boxdetails.png(){#fig-relationship-edit-boxes-boxdetails-1}

If you want to enforce referential integrity for this relation then check the box [Enforce Referential Integrity]{.uicontrol}.

A relationship can be modified by first selecting the relationship line. This line is then displayed thicker. Then double-clicking will display the dialog box ***Edit Relationships***.

You can delete a relationship by selecting the relationship line and then press the [DELETE]{.uicontrol} key.

### Referential integrity {#sec-tables-referential-integrity}

Referential integrity is a system of rules by which it is ensured that the internal consistency between the tables is ensured. Access then ensures that relations between records in related tables are valid, and related information is not inadvertently removed or altered.

Referential integrity is handled through the dialog box ***Edit Relationships*** by selecting the box [Enforce Referential Integrity]{.uicontrol}.

::: callout-important
**Consequences Referential Integrity**

- You cannot enter a value for the foreign key in the related table if that value does not exist in the primary key of the primary table. For example, you cannot enter an order for a non-existent customer. With an order for a new customer, you must therefore first create the customer and only then the order.

- You cannot delete a record from the primary table if there is a record that relates in another related table. For example, you cannot delete a record from the [Customers]{.varname} table if records for this customer still exist in the [Orders]{.varname} table.

- You cannot change the value of the primary key in the primary table if there is a record that relates in another related table. For example, you cannot change the customer code in the [Customers]{.varname} table if records in the [Orders]{.varname} table are assigned to this customer.
:::

When the referential integrity is enforced and any of the foregoing rules is violated by an action, then an appropriate error message is displayed. In @fig-warning-referential-integrity you see an example of this.

![Error message when entering an order for a non existing client.](images/tables/warning-referential-integrity.png){#fig-warning-referential-integrity}

You can set referential integrity between two tables on the following conditions

-   Both of these tables are in the same Access database.
-   The linked field in the primary table is a primary key or has a unique index.
-   The linked fields have the same data type and numeric fields must have the same field length.
-   Existing data in both tables don't violate the rules of referential integrity.

::: callout-warning
AutoNumber fields may be linked to fields of the type `Number` providing that the property [Field Size]{.uicontrol} has the value `Long Integer`.
:::

When existing data in the tables break the rules for referential integrity, these violations must be addressed first. Usually, these problems arise by any of the following causes.

1.  The fields that are linked to each other are not of the same data type or do not have the same length. This is easy to solve by changes in the design of one or both tables.

2.  In the table at the many-side exist records with values in the linking field that don't exist in the table at the one-side. This occurs when you delete a record in the table on the on- side without deleting the corresponding records in the table on the many-side. In fact, this creates orphans in the table on the many-side. Fortunately, Access provides a type of query with which you can find these orphans and delete them yet. If this is the case, select [tab Create \> Query Wizard (group Queries) \> Find Unmatched Query Wizard]{.uicontrol}.

### Create Relationship Boxes-BoxDetails {#sec-tables-relationship}

A relationship connects two fields in different tables together. Before you start creating the relation, you must first determine which table is the primary table, which the related table and which fields are the linking fields.

Until now there is no relationship between the tables [Boxes]{.varname} and [BoxDetails]{.varname}. This is necessary because otherwise, it is not possible to determine which pralines and the amount of them are in a particular box.

-   Primary table: [Boxes]{.varname}, link field [BoxCode]{.varname}
-   Related table: [BoxDetails]{.varname}, link field [BoxCode]{.varname}

1.  Open the database.

2.  Click [tab Database Tools \> Relationships (group Relationships)]{.uicontrol}. Window Relationships will be displayed. It shows the existing relations. You can also see that currently no relationships exists between the tables [Boxes]{.varname} and [BoxDetails]{.varname}.

![Window relationships.](images/tables/relationships-window-boxes-boxdetails.png){#fig-relationships-window-boxes-boxdetails}

3.  Select in table [Boxes]{.varname} the field [BoxCode]{.varname} and drag it to the field [BoxCode]{.varname} in table [BoxDetails]{.varname}.

![Dialog box Edit Relationships.](images/tables/relationship-edit-boxes-boxdetails.png){#fig-relationship-edit-boxes-boxdetails-2}

4.  Check the box [Enforce Referential Integrity]{.uicontrol} and click [Create]{.uicontrol}. The relationship is now visible in the window.

## Exercises {#sec-tables-exercises}

::: {#exr-tabl001}
**Prevent duplicate names (tabl001)**

The [Suppliers]{.varname} table has a field [Supplier]{.varname}. This is the name of the supplier. It is now possible to use the same supplier name more than once, which is undesirable. To prevent this, you can set the value of the property [Indexed]{.uicontrol} of this field on [Yes (No Duplicates)]{.uicontrol}. Apply this change.
:::

::: {#exr-tabl002}
**Insertion in names (tabl002)**

The last name of the customer with CustomerCode 15 is `Molen, van de` and the first name is `Robert`. If you use these names when creating labels, then you will see: `Robert Molen, van de`. This is not professional and you want the name to be listed on the label `Robert van de Molen`. A possible solution could be to change [LastName]{.varname} in `van de Molen`. But this solution has the drawback that the sort by name will produce an undesired sequence. Think of a better solution, if necessary the design of the table may be changed. Do not apply this change in the database.
:::

::: {#exr-tabl003}
**Title field with a list box (tabl003)**

Some customers appreciate that their title is listed with a mailing. Add a field [Title]{.varname} to table [Customers]{.varname}. Use data type [Lookup Wizard]{.uicontrol} to produce a list with the values: ing. , ir., drs., mr., dr.
:::

::: {#exr-tabl004}
**Currency format (tabl004)**

In this exercise, you need the table [Transport]{.varname} that had to be made earlier in the course. When this table is not present in your database, you have two possibilities:

+ You still perform the task by creating this table.
+ You use database `transport.accdb` where the table [Transport]{.varname} already was made for you.

Open table [Transport]{.varname} and note that the transport costs do not appear in a currency format. Change the value of the property [Format]{.uicontrol} of field [TransportationCosts]{.varname} in a currency format with your local currency symbol. Then switch to datasheet view and observe the result of the change.

::: {.callout-note}
The showed currency symbol depends on the local Windows settings.

::: {#exr-tabl005}
**Composite key (tabl005)**

In this exercise, you need the table [Transport]{.varname} that had to be made earlier in the course, see  @sec-tables-manually. When this table is not present in your database, you have two possibilities:

+ You still perform the task by creating this table.
+ You use database `transport.accdb` where the table [Transport]{.varname} already was made for you.

In the [Transport]{.varname} table, the [ID TransportCompany]{.varname} field regularly has the same value. So you can see 13 times the value 1. Therefore, this field can not serve as a primary key. The value of [DeliveryProvince]{.varname} appears three times because each carrier has a rate per province. The field [DeliveryProvince]{.varname} therefore can not serve as a primary key. The combination of the fields [ID TransportCompany]{.varname} and [DeliveryProvince]{.varname} is unique and can therefore be used as a primary key. Set this as primary key table [Transport]{.varname}.

::: {#exr-tabl006}
**A field target group with a list box (tabl006)**

There is a need to classify each customer in one of the following target groups: top customer, good customer, small customer. To do this the design of the [Customers]{.varname} table needs to be modified. Make a new field in this table with the name [TargetGroup]{.varname} with a list box with the values mentioned before.
:::

::: {#exr-tabl007}
**Relationship BoxDetails-Pralines (tabl007)**

Create a relationship between the tables [BoxDetails]{.varname} and [Pralines]{.varname} and enforce referential integrity.
:::

::: {#exr-tabl008}
**Table Employees (tabl008)**

Late 2010 was decided to track which employee has entered an order. There is already an Excel file containing the data of all employees. Perform the following actions:

+ Import the Excel file `employees.xlsx` and give the table the name [Employees]{.varname}. Provide an appropriate primary key for this table.
+ Add a field [EmployeeCode]{.varname}.
+ Create a relationship between the tables [Orders]{.varname} and [Employees]{.varname} and enforce referential integrity.
:::

::: {#exr-tabl009}
**Contact registration (tabl009)**

The marketing department wants to record all contacts ( telephone, mail, email, visits) in order to calculate the costs incurred for a customer. For each contact, the contact type, date, start time and end time, subject, and any charges (e.g. to send a gift) are tracked. If for example an employee has spent half an hour with a letter, then it must be possible to calculate later that the costs are `0.5 * $60`.

To do this, create a new table named [Contacts]{.varname} and link this to table [Customers]{.varname} and enforce referential integrity.
:::

::: {#exr-tabl010}
**Complaints registration (tabl010)**

There are complaints from customers. The complaints can be classified into the following categories: Packaging damaged, Box not delivered on the date, Best before date has expired, Pralines don't taste.

A complaint always refers to an order. Create new table [Complaints]{.varname} and link this to table [Orders]{.varname} and enforce referential integrity.
:::

::: {#exr-tabl011}
**Referential integrity (tabl011)**

Check if the referential integrity is enforced at the relationships of tables [Customers]{.varname}, [Orders]{.varname}, [OrderDetails]{.varname}, [Boxes]{.varname}, [BoxDetails]{.varname}, and [Pralines]{.varname}. If not, do it.
