Access, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word are often used as standalone programs. However, in many business scenarios, collaboration between them is essential—and Microsoft Office offers plenty of options to support this integration.

## About Office Integration {#sec-integration-about}

The Microsoft Office applications are designed to work together, allowing seamless data exchange across programs. Still, many users treat Access, Excel, and Word as entirely separate tools—each with its own strengths:

-   Access for managing structured data (databases).
-   Excel for calculations and numerical analysis.
-   Word for word processing.

Access allows you to export data from tables, queries, and forms to Excel for calculations that may not be possible within Access. Similarly, Access can import data from Excel worksheets.

You can also export Access data to Word in RTF format (Rich Text Format). Additionally, Access tables or queries can be used as data sources in Word’s Mail Merge function, which can be initiated from either Word or Access.

## Mail Merge {#sec-mailmerge}

In this task, you'll send a form letter to customers announcing a new voucher box called [Snow White]{.varname}. The address data will come from the [Customers]{.varname} table.

:::: {#prp-mailmerge}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `{{< var database >}}`

1.  Open the database.

2.  Select the [Customers]{.varname} table.

3.  Right-click the table and choose [Export \> Word Merge]{.uicontrol}.

4.  Choose [Link your data to an existing Microsoft Word document]{.uicontrol} and click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

5.  Select the practice file `snow-white.docx` and click [Open]{.uicontrol}. Microsoft Word opens with the document loaded. The [Mailings]{.uicontrol} tab is active, and the *Mail Merge* panel appears on the right. You're now in step 3 of 6.

![Progress wizard mail merge: step 3 of 6.](images/integration/mailmerge-wizard-step3.png){#fig-mailmerge-wizard-step3}

6.  Click [Next: Write your letter]{.uicontrol}.

7.  Place the cursor at the top of the letter. Go to [Mailings \> Insert Merge Field \> FirstName]{.uicontrol}.

8.  Then add the following fields in the format below:

    ```         
    <<FirstName>> <<LastName>>
    <<Address>>
    <<ZipCode>>  <<City>>
    ```

9.  In the Mail Merge panel, click [Next: Preview your letters]{.uicontrol} (Step 4 of 6). The first customer’s letter will be displayed.

10. Then click [Next: Complete the merge]{.uicontrol} (Step 5 of 6).

::: callout-note
You now have two options:

-   [Print]{.uicontrol} to send letters directly to the printer.
-   [Edit individual letters]{.uicontrol} to generate one document with all letters.
:::

11. Click [Edit individual letters]{.uicontrol}.

![Selection of records.](images/integration/mailmerge-wizard-records.png){#fig-mailmerge-wizard-records}

12. In the prompt, choose to generate letters for the first 10 customers. Click [OK]{.uicontrol}. A new Word document with 10 letters is created.

13. Save the document as [Invitation new box]{.varname} and close Word.

## Export to Word {#sec-export-word}

Goal: Export an Access table to a new RTF document.

If you want to insert the content of a table or query into an existing Word document, the easiest method is to copy and paste. However, you can also export directly to a new Word file. This creates a Rich Text Format (.rtf) file that can be opened in Word.

::: {#prp-export-word}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `{{< var database >}}`

1.  Open the database.

2.  Select the [Boxes]{.varname} table.

3.  Right-click the table and choose [Export \> Word RTF File]{.uicontrol}. The *Export - RTF File* dialog appears.

4.  Enter the file name and path, then click [OK]{.uicontrol}. The *Save Export Steps* dialog appears.

5.  You don't need to save the export steps. Click [Close]{.uicontrol}.

6.  Open the exported file in Word to verify.
:::

## Export to Excel {#sec-export-excel}

Goal: Export an Access table to a new Excel workbook.

Exporting a table from Access to Excel is straightforward.

::: {#prp-export-excel}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `{{< var database >}}`

1.  Open the database.

2.  Select the [Boxes]{.varname} table.

3.  Right-click the table and choose [Export \> Excel]{.uicontrol}. The *Export - Excel Spreadsheet* dialog appears.

4.  Specify a file name and path, select [Export data with formatting and layout]{.uicontrol}, then click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

5.  In the next dialog (***Save Export Steps***), click [Close]{.uicontrol}—saving is optional.

6.  Open the file in Excel to check the export.
