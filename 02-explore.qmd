This course is centered around the sample file `{{< var database >}}`. This chapter explains the design and use of the tables in the database. You will experiment with this sample database to discover different aspects of working with Access. Some features are explored further in other chapters.

## Example Database Candy {#sec-explore-about}

The example database `{{< var database >}}` contains data from the company SNOOPY, which sells boxes of pralines to customers. Each box contains different types of pralines. The information is stored in six tables:

-   [Customers]{.varname}
-   [Orders]{.varname}
-   [OrderDetails]{.varname}
-   [Boxes]{.varname}
-   [BoxDetails]{.varname}
-   [Pralines]{.varname}

![Design database Candy.](images/explore/example-db-design.png){#fig-example-db-design}

Customer data is stored in the [Customers]{.varname} table. Customer orders are recorded in the [Orders]{.varname} and [OrderDetails]{.varname} tables. Information about each box of pralines, such as name and price, is stored in the [Boxes]{.varname} table. The [BoxDetails]{.varname} table shows which pralines and how many of each are in each box. The [Pralines]{.varname} table contains details about each praline, including its name, chocolate type, filling, and even a picture.

::: callout-note
Each table should include a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row. This is often a unique identification number, such as an article number or employee number. In database terminology, this is called the **primary key** of the table. The value of the primary key must be unique in the table; duplicate values are not allowed. Most tables have a primary key consisting of a single field, but sometimes a combination of fields is needed to ensure uniqueness.

In the [Customers]{.varname}, [Orders]{.varname}, [Boxes]{.varname}, and [Pralines]{.varname} tables, the key is a single field. In the [OrderDetails]{.varname} and [BoxDetails]{.varname} tables, two fields are required for the key. See @fig-example-db-design.
:::

The six tables are briefly discussed below.

### Table Customers {#sec-explore-table-customers}

![Table Customers.](images/explore/table-customers.png){#fig-table-customers}

The [Customers]{.varname} table stores various details about each customer. Every customer has a unique customer code. The [CustomerCode]{.varname} field is the primary key of the table. Each row in a table is called a record. Customers are sorted by the primary key.

> Check that there are 325 customers in the [Customers]{.varname} table.

### Table Orders {#sec-explore-table-orders}

![Table Orders.](images/explore/table-orders.png){#fig-table-orders}

In the [Orders]{.varname} table, [OrderCode]{.varname} is the primary key, and its value is unique. A specific [CustomerCode]{.varname} can appear more than once in this table because a customer can place multiple orders. Each order is always associated with one customer.

> Check that there are 784 orders in the [Orders]{.varname} table.

### Table OrderDetails {#sec-explore-table-orderdetails}

![Table OrderDetails.](images/explore/table-orderdetails.png){#fig-table-orderdetails}

An order can contain multiple boxes, but each [BoxCode]{.varname} can only appear once per order. However, a particular box can be ordered in multiple orders, so a [BoxCode]{.varname} can be linked to multiple [OrderCode]{.varname} values. The [OrderDetails]{.varname} table has 1,537 records (order rows).

> Check that two different boxes were ordered in the order with order code 3, as the table contains two rows with order code 3. A total of three boxes were ordered in this order: two boxes with box code CHER and one box with box code NOWI.

The combination of [OrderCode]{.varname} and [BoxCode]{.varname} is always unique. Therefore, the key in this table is a combination of these two fields.

::: callout-note
The total number of boxes ordered across all orders is the sum of all values in the Quantity column. This number is not present in the table. Another chapter in this course will explain how to calculate it.
:::

### Table Boxes {#sec-explore-table-boxes}

![Table Boxes.](images/explore/table-boxes.png){#fig-table-boxes}

In the [Boxes]{.varname} table, [BoxCode]{.varname} is the key. There are 18 different boxes, each with a unique [BoxCode]{.varname}. This table serves as the Snoopy company's product list.

### Table BoxDetails {#sec-explore-table-boxdetails}

![Table BoxDetails.](images/explore/table-boxdetails.png){#fig-table-boxdetails}

The [BoxDetails]{.varname} table stores which types of pralines and how many of each are in a specific box. For example, you can see that box ALLS contains six types of pralines, two of each, for a total of twelve pralines. In this table, the key is a combination of [BoxCode]{.varname} and [PralineCode]{.varname}. The table has 84 records.

### Table Pralines {#sec-explore-table-pralines}

![Table Pralines.](images/explore/table-pralines.png){#fig-table-pralines}

The [Pralines]{.varname} table stores properties of each type of praline. The key is the [PralineCode]{.varname} field. The table contains 41 records (praline types).

You can easily perform some calculations based on the data from these tables.

1.  **What is the average number of praline types per box?**\
    Divide the total number of records in the [BoxDetails]{.varname} table by the total number of box types: $\frac{84}{18}= 4.7$.

2.  **What is the average number of box types per order?**\
    Divide the total number of order rows by the total number of orders: $\frac{1537}{784} = 2.0$.

You can't easily calculate the average number of pralines in a box. To do this, you need the total number of pralines in all boxes, which is the sum of all values in the [Quantity]{.varname} column in the [BoxDetails]{.varname} table.

## Security and Macros {#sec-explore-security}

How to handle security warnings when opening a database.

Some databases, such as `{{< var database >}}`, contain macros. In most cases, these macros are designed to perform specific tasks in the database. However, virus writers can use macros to spread malware. When a database is not in a trusted location or signed by a trusted publisher, Access displays a security warning when opening the database, and macros are disabled.

![Security warning on opening of a database with macros.](images/common/security-warning.png){#fig-security-warning}

You can enable macros in one of the following ways.

### Enable Macros Temporarily {.unnumbered}

Click the [Enable Content]{.uicontrol} button in the area with the security alert.

This method is not recommended because you will have to enable macros every time you open the database and see this warning.

### Add Publisher to Trusted Publishers List {.unnumbered}

If the database creator has provided a digital certificate, you can add the creator to the Trusted Publishers list. Access will automatically enable all macros created by this publisher in all databases. This is a very secure method, but usually only larger companies use digital certificates. The database `{{< var database >}}` does not have a digital certificate.

### Move Database to a Trusted Location {.unnumbered}

Access provides trusted locations (folders). Macros in databases stored in a trusted location are automatically enabled. This is the most convenient and recommended way to work safely without interruptions from security alerts for the database `{{< var database >}}`. To do this:

Go to [File \> Options \> Trust Center \> Trust Center Settings... \> Trusted Locations \> Add new location...]{.uicontrol}.

![Dialog box Microsoft Office trusted location.](images/common/security-trusted-location.png){#fig-security-trusted-location}

In this example, the folder `C:\temp` is added as a trusted location.

### Security Settings for All Macros {.unnumbered}

Optionally, you can change how Access handles all macros in all databases:

Go to [File \> Options \> Trust Center \> Trust Center Settings... \> Macro Settings]{.uicontrol}

![Dialog box Trust Center.](images/common/security-trust-center.png){#fig-security-trust-center}

It is not recommended to enable all macros, as this removes important security controls.

## Exploring the Database {#sec-explore-database}

To explore, you must have the database `{{< var database >}}` open.

::: callout-note
If a security warning is displayed, you should take action as described in @sec-explore-security.
:::

![Access with the Snoopy database with opened group Tables.](images/common/access-window.png){#fig-explore-access-window}

The Navigation Pane is on the left side and contains all objects in the database. Objects are divided into groups: [Tables]{.uicontrol}, [Queries]{.uicontrol}, [Forms]{.uicontrol}, [Reports]{.uicontrol}, [Macros]{.uicontrol}. In the example, the [Tables]{.uicontrol} group is expanded. The navigation pane and its groups can be expanded or collapsed.

-   ![](images/common/button-object-selection.png) - select which objects are shown

-   ![](images/common/button-group-open.png) - expand a group pane

-   ![](images/common/button-group-close.png) - collapse a group pane

-   ![](images/common/button-navigation-close.png) - collapse the navigation pane

-   ![](images/common/button-navigation-open.png) - expand the navigation pane

Double-clicking an object in the Navigation Pane opens it and displays its contents in a document window. If you open several objects, they are displayed as tabbed documents.

![Document window with the Customers and Orders tables in tabs.](images/explore/document-tabs.png){#fig-document-tabs}

::: callout-note
You can change this setting through [File \> Options \> Current Database]{.uicontrol}. In @fig-document-window-options, you can see the available document window options.

![Document Window Options.](images/common/document-window-options.png){#fig-document-window-options}

If you select [Overlapping Windows]{.uicontrol}, objects are displayed in separate windows, overlapping each other.
:::

If you need more horizontal space, you can collapse the navigation pane. If you need more vertical space, you can hide the ribbon by double-clicking a ribbon tab. Double-clicking again will show the ribbon.

## Exploring Tables {#sec-explore-tables}

Tables are the key components of a database, as all data is stored here.

The two most important views of a table are:

Datasheet View

:   In this view, you can see and edit the contents of records, and add new records.

Design View

:   In this view, you can see and modify the design of the table.

:::: {#prp-explore-tables}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `{{< var database >}}`

1.  Open the database.

2.  Open the [Customers]{.varname} table. The table opens in Datasheet View.

::: callout-note
In the [Orders]{.varname} table, there is an expand button `+` in front of the records. Clicking it shows the order details, which come from the [OrderDetails]{.varname} table. The associated details can be found because both tables contain the [OrderCode]{.varname} field.
:::

7.  Click the expand button on a few records to see which boxes and how many were ordered.

![Orders details of order 3.](images/explore/table-orders-details3.png){#fig-table-orders-details3}

8.  Close the [Orders]{.varname} table.
::::

## Exploring Forms {#sec-explore-forms}

Forms are especially important for displaying, adding, and editing data.

The main views of a form are:

Form View

:   In this view, information is displayed, and you can edit or enter new data.

Datasheet View

:    A view similar to that of the table.

Design View

:   In this view, you can see and modify the design of the form.

::: callout-note
In Design View, you can change the layout of the form and add controls such as text boxes, labels, list boxes, checkboxes, and more.
:::

4.  Switch the [Pralines]{.varname} form back to Form View using ![](images/common/button-form-view.png).

5.  Browse through the records using the navigation buttons at the bottom left of the document window.

    -   ![](images/common/button-record-first.png) - First record

    -   ![](images/common/button-record-previous.png) - Previous record

    -   ![](images/common/button-record-next.png) - Next record

    -   ![](images/common/button-record-last.png) - Last record

    -   ![](images/common/button-record-new.png) - New (empty) record

6.  Close the form.
::::

## Using a Command Button {#sec-explore-commandbutton}

The [Boxes]{.varname} form can be used for data entry as well as for viewing data. This form includes a command button labeled [Sales]{.varname}.

::: {#prp-explore-commandbutton}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `{{< var database >}}`

1.  Open the database.

2.  Open the [Boxes]{.varname} form.

3.  Click the [Sales]{.varname} button on the form. The [Box sales]{.varname} form is displayed. You will see all orders related to the selected box in the [Boxes]{.varname} form, including the total sales for that box.

4.  Close all forms.
:::

## Searching for a Record {#sec-explore-search-records}

A form can also be used to search for a record. In the following steps, you will search for a box with "autumn" in its name.

::: {#prp-explore-search-records}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `{{< var database >}}`

1.  Open the database.

2.  Open the [Boxes]{.varname} form.

3.  Click in the [Box name]{.varname} field and, on the ribbon, choose [Home tab \>]{.uicontrol} ![](images/common/button-find.png) [Find (Find group)]{.uicontrol}. The ***Find and Replace*** dialog box appears.

4.  Type "autumn" in the [Find What]{.uicontrol} text box and select [Any Part of Field]{.uicontrol} in the [Match]{.uicontrol} box.

![Dialog box find and replace.](images/explore/find-replace-dialogbox.png){#fig-find-replace-dialogbox}

5.  Click [Find Next]{.uicontrol}. The content for the box "Autumn Surprise" is displayed.

6.  Click [Cancel]{.uicontrol} to close the search window.

7.  Close the form.
:::

## Exploring Queries {#sec-explore-queries}

Queries are important for selecting or summarizing data from tables. A query is a specific question to the database to retrieve certain information.

The two most important views of a query are:

Datasheet View

:   In this view, you can see the result (data) of the query.

Design View

:   In this view, you can see and modify the design of the query.

::::: {#prp-explore-queries}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `{{< var database >}}`

1.  Open the database.

2.  Open the [Pralines per box]{.varname} query.

::: callout-note
Access executes the query and displays a datasheet with the results, as shown in @fig-query-pralines-box-datasheet.

The results of this query are derived from multiple tables. To see which tables are used, switch to the query's Design View.
:::

![Query pralines per box in datasheet view.](images/explore/query-pralines-box-datasheet.png){#fig-query-pralines-box-datasheet}

![Design query Pralines per box.](images/explore/query-pralines-box-design.png){#fig-query-pralines-box-design}

::: callout-note
The upper three rectangles represent the tables used in this query. The lines with arrows connect the field names by which the tables are related.

In the lower part of this window, the first row contains the names of the fields used. In the third column is an expression, a formula that performs operations on the fields. The expression here is `Sum([Pralines].[PralineCosts]*[BoxDetails].[Quantity])`. The names in brackets indicate the tables and fields.

To see the entire expression, widen the column by dragging its right edge.
:::

4.  Switch the query back to Datasheet View.

5.  Close the query
:::::

## Exploring Reports {#sec-explore-reports}

Reports allow you to print information from tables in a well-organized layout, either on screen or on paper. The displayed data may come from multiple tables and/or queries, and calculated values are possible. You can also add titles, headings, headers, and footers to a report.

The main views of a report are:

Report View

:   In this view, you can see the contents of the report.

Print Preview

:   Shows how the report will look when printed.

Design View

:   In this view, you can see and modify the design of the report.

:::: {#prp-explore-reports}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `{{< var database >}}`

1.  Open the database.

2.  Open the [Pralines per box]{.varname} report. The report opens in the Report View.

![Report pralines per box in report view.](images/explore/report-pralines-box-report.png){#fig-report-pralines-box-report}

3.  Switch the [Pralines per box]{.varname} report to Print Preview in one of the following ways:

    -   Click the [Print Preview]{.uicontrol} button in the bottom right of the program window ![](images/common/button-print-preview.png)

![Report pralines per box in design view.](images/explore/report-pralines-box-design.png){#fig-report-pralines-box-design}

::: callout-note
In Design View, you can change the layout of the report and add controls such as text boxes, labels, list boxes, checkboxes, and more.
:::

5.  Switch the report back to [Report View]{.uicontrol} using ![](images/common/button-report-view.png).

6.  Close the report
::::

## Sorting {#sec-explore-sorting}

You can sort the records in a table based on the values in one or more fields, either in ascending or descending order.

In the next exercise, you will modify the [Customers]{.varname} table to create an overview sorted first by city, then by last name, and then by first name.

![Table Customers, sorted on city, last name and first name.](images/explore/table-customers-sorted.png){#fig-table-customers-sorted}

::::: {#prp-explore-sorting}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `{{< var database >}}`

1.  Open the database.

2.  Open the [Customers]{.varname} table. The table opens in Datasheet View.

3.  Select the [City]{.varname} column by clicking its header and drag it to the left to make it the first column.

4.  Similarly, move the [LastName]{.varname} and [FirstName]{.varname} columns to the second and third positions, respectively.

5.  Click the arrow on the right side of the [City]{.varname} column header and select [Sort A to Z]{.uicontrol} from the shortcut menu.

::: callout-note
Access reorganizes the records in alphabetical order by city and shows a small upward-pointing arrow (![](images/common/button-arrow-down-sortedup.png)) at the right side of the column header to indicate the sort order.
:::

6.  Remove the sorting by choosing [Home tab \> Remove Sort (Sort & Filter group)]{.uicontrol}.

7.  To sort by multiple fields, select the [City]{.varname}, [LastName]{.varname}, and [FirstName]{.varname} columns.

8.  Choose [Home tab \> Ascending ![](images/common/button-sort-ascending.png) (Sort & Filter group)]{.uicontrol}.

::: callout-note
Access reorganizes the records in alphabetical order by city and shows a small upward-pointing arrow (![](images/common/button-arrow-down-sortedup.png)) at the right side of the column header to indicate the sort order.
:::

9.  Close the [Customers]{.varname} table and choose [No]{.uicontrol} when asked to save changes.
:::::

## Filtering {#sec-explore-filtering}

Filtering is a useful way to display only the data you want to see. You can use filters to display specific records in a form, report, query, or table. For example, you can easily create a filter to show all pralines with chocolate type "Milk" and filling type "Marzipan." Several filtering methods are discussed in the following exercises.

### Simple Filter {#sec-explore-filter-simpel}

**Information needed:** Show all pralines with chocolate type "White."

:::: {#prp-explore-filter-simpel}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `{{< var database >}}`

1.  Open the database.

2.  Open the [Pralines]{.varname} table. The table opens in Datasheet View.

3.  Click a value "White" in the [ChocolateType]{.varname} column.

4.  Choose [Home tab \> Selection (Sort & Filter group) \> Equals "White"]{.uicontrol}.

::: callout-note
Access now shows the records (4 records) where the chocolate type is white. You can see that a filter has been applied:

-   A small filter icon appears to the right of the [ChocolateType]{.varname} column header (![](images/common/button-arrow-down-filter.png))
-   The status bar shows ![](images/explore/statusbar-filtered.png)
:::
::::

### Modifying a Filter {#sec-explore-filter-modify}

**Information needed:** Show all pralines with chocolate type "Milk."

Here, you will modify the previous filter.

:::: {#prp-explore-filter-modify}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `{{< var database >}}`

1.  Click the filter icon to the right of the [ChocolateType]{.varname} column header.

![Dialog box filter.](images/explore/filter-chocolatetype.png){#fig-filter-chocolatetype}

2.  In the dialog box, select "Milk" and deselect "White." Click [OK]{.uicontrol}. Now, 18 records are shown, all with chocolate type "Milk."

::: callout-note
The options shown in @fig-filter-chocolatetype depend on the field type. For a text field, there is a [Text Filters]{.uicontrol} submenu; for a numeric field, there is a [Number Filters]{.uicontrol} submenu.
:::
::::

### Filter on Two Criteria {#sec-explore-filter-criteria2}

**Information needed:** Show all pralines with chocolate type "Milk" and filling type "Marzipan."

Here, you add a second selection criterion.

:::: {#prp-explore-filter-criteria2}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `{{< var database >}}`

1.  Click a value "Marzipan" in the [FillingType]{.vartype} column.

2.  Choose [Home tab \> Selection (Sort & Filter group) \> Equals "Marzipan"]{.uicontrol}.

    Three records are displayed with chocolate type "Milk" and filling type "Marzipan."

3.  Remove the filter by choosing [Home tab \> ![](images/common/button-filter-toggle.png) (Sort & Filter group)]{.uicontrol}.

::: callout-note
Filtering is removed and all records are displayed again.

Another way to remove the filter is by clicking the [Filtered]{.uicontrol} button in the status bar. The text on the button will change to [Unfiltered]{.uicontrol}. Clicking again reapplies the last used filter.
:::
::::

### Number Filter {#sec-explore-filter-number}

**Information needed:** Show all pralines with costs from \$0.25 to \$0.35.

::: {#prp-explore-filter-number}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `{{< var database >}}`

1.  Click the arrow in the [PralineCosts]{.varname} column header, then choose [Number Filters \> Between...]{.uicontrol}.

![Between Numbers dialog box.](images/explore/filter-number-between.png){#fig-filter-number-between}

2.  Enter 0.25 for [Smallest]{.uicontrol}, 0.35 for [Largest]{.uicontrol}, then click [OK]{.uicontrol}. Now, 22 records are shown with praline costs from 0.25 to 0.35.

3.  Close the [Pralines]{.varname} table and choose [No]{.uicontrol} when asked to save changes.
:::

## Printing {#sec-explore-print}

Access uses the printers available in Windows for printing.

Depending on the view of an Access object, the result can be printed. For example, you can print datasheet views for tables and queries, report views for reports, and form views for forms.

::: callout-note
There is no option to print the design view, but Access has a tool called [Database Documenter]{.uicontrol} that lets you print the design characteristics of database objects.
:::

Print options are available through [File \> Print]{.uicontrol}. You have the following options:

![Print options in Access.](images/common/print-options.png){#fig-print-options}

With [Print Preview]{.uicontrol}, you can customize the printout, such as page size, orientation, margins, and more.
